Project Title: Forest Fire Risk Assessment in Montesinho Park, Portugal

Project Description/Outline:

We aim to analyze a dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing information about forest fires in Montesinho Park, Portugal. This dataset encompasses a wide range of data, including, but not limited to, the affected area, weather conditions, and the collection month.

Our primary objectives include identifying the key factors that contribute to an elevated risk of forest fires, understanding the factors that lead to more severe fire incidents, and proposing strategies for Montesinho Park to potentially mitigate future forest fire risks.

Research Questions to Answer:
Are there any seasonal trends in the occurrence, and extent of impact of forest fires in the park?
Is the day of the week correlated to the likelihood of forest fires occurring in the park?
From the collected data what are the factors that correlate most heavily with the occurrence of forest fires?
From the collected data what are the factors that correlate most heavily with the severity of forest fires?
What regions are more susceptible to forest fire outbreaks?
What regions are the most susceptible to experiencing heavy damage from a forest fire outbreak?

Dataset to Be Used: Forest Fire-area Datasets
